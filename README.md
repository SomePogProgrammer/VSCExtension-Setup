1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Extract the files if downloaded as a ZIP.
3. Open PowerShell and navigate to the extracted directory.

## Usage

To run the script, you can use the following commands:

```powershell
VSC-ExtensionSetup                       # Uses suggested extensions
VSC-ExtensionSetup <ExtensionsFilePath>  # Uses extensions from the specified file (overrides suggestion/default)
    ---------------------------
     Format is: 
        [author.extensionName]
     Example: extensions.txt
        bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
        brandonfowler.exe-runner
        christian-kohler.npm-intellisense
        ...
```
## Commands
```powershell
 --help                        Display this help message
 --list                        List all pre-hardcoded extensions
  <ExtensionsFilePath>         Path to a .txt file containing a list of extensions
```

# Creating an Extensions File

If you want to just bulk install other extensions and use this for that, that's okay!

**To create a custom extensions file:**

 - Create a new text file (e.g., extensions.txt).
 - Add one extension ID per line, formatted as follows:
 ```txt
    author.extensionName
    # Example
    bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
 ```
 *A sample.txt file is in the repo for further example*

*If you want to add onto the extensions, you can also create an extension file.*

Including this file will override the default ‚ö†Ô∏è

To avoid that:
 Either:
    - Run the command without args first, then add a file path. (recommended)
    or
    - Use the --list command and add it manually to your file.


# Help

You can use the `--help` command as follows:
```powershell
    command --help
```

If you want to know the default extensions you can do:
```powershell
    command --list 
```
